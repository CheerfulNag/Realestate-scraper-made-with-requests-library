This is a simple site parser that does not require javascript rendering, so it was made using the requests library. I also used concurrent.futures, so for 1500 pages the program will complete in just ~ 5 minutes instead of a few wasted hours. Also in case if you'll set amount of pages more than exists in the site, there will be no duplicates.
